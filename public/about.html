                Management of invoices and maintainig their records for further processing sometimes it is hectic and buying specially
developed software is not worth for small enterprises. The majority of businesses has similar requirement and most of
them use the traditional management system like recording the data manually and maintaining hardcopies, a result, it
consumes a lot time as well as space.The prime objective is to make data available for the user so that the user can
access it anytime from anywhere and can modify it if need. Considering availability and accessibility this will help to
achieve objectives.

Our system focuses on the extraction of invoice data and segregates it into different parts like Vendor name,
Invoice number, item name, and quantity. Our system tries to find out a better Management solution for auditing. We
have initially focus on image invoices.The proposed solution follows three main steps preprocessing with the help of
different OpenCV techniques and functions, then the next step is data extraction with the help of OCR technology and
post-processing with the help of RegEx technology for better accuracy.
